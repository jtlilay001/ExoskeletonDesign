# Upper Extremity Exoskeleton Design

The active exoskeleton design is an ortheses project that is designed for assistive purposes for the upper extremity. The design begins by developing a relationship between the individual joints of the manipulator and the end effector. 

### Forward Kinematics 
Forward Kinematics is used to determine the position and orientation of the end effector given that the joint variables are known. The joint variables are the angles between the links for revolute or rotational joints and the distance between between prismatic or sliding joints. 

##### Denavit-Hartenberg Representation  
The Denavit-Hartenberg convention is a systematic approach for determining the position and orientation of the end effector. The D-H method takes each homogenous transformation (A<sub>i</sub>) and represented as the product of four basic transformations.
